The directory holds a set of .css files.
The .css files can be put in subdirectories
Each .css file is considered as the one to be used so do not use the .css
extention for the included files.
Each file holds a style sheet for a certain form.
The name of a file must match a name of the form it is purposed for.
A special file Application.css is purposed for the application level style
sheet.

The actual description must follow to what is supported by QT.
There are a few additions though:
- # started lines are considered as remarks. The '#' symbol must be at 0
  position.
- INCLUDE <path to a file> is supported. INCLUDE must start at 0 position

The additions are processed first and then an assebled text is passed to a
form or an application.
